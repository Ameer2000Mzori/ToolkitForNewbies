first you need to enter app.routes.ts file

then import the components needed for the routing

then do the following code or type to make your /intro / intro component default component in your app.

export const routes: Routes = [
{ path: '', redirectTo: '/intro', pathMatch: 'full' },
{ path: 'intro', component: IntroPageComponent },
{ path: 'game', component: PuzzleComponent },
{ path: 'about', component: AboutPageComponent },
{ path: 'scores', component: ScoresPageComponent },
{ path: '**', redirectTo: '/intro', pathMatch: 'full' },
];


then you need to go to the component were you need to implement the routing 


as following i'm using IntroPageComponent were i will use my routing 

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterLink, RouterLinkActive } from '@angular/router';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-intro-page',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [RouterLink, RouterLinkActive],
  templateUrl: './intro-page.component.html',
  styleUrl: './intro-page.component.scss',
})
export class IntroPageComponent {
  title = 'sliding-puzzle';
}


as you can see i have imported two modules and ( RouterLink , RouterLinkActive)

and then you have to do the following inside of your html component 


  <a routerLink="/about" routerLinkActive="active">About Page</a>
  <a routerLink="/scores">scores</a>



  this way you can use routing but this way is not lazy loading.
