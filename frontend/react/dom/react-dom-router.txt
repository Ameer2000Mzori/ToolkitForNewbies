this is document how to use react-dom-router

first download the react-dom-router from npm 

enter the next command in terminal 
=> npm i react-router-dom


do the following things in your app.jsx file 

=> import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

then you need to import the components you need to use 

then you do the following thing 

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from './components/pages/Home.jsx'
import About from './components/pages/About.jsx'
import Navbar from './components/Navbar.jsx'

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Navbar />
      <Routes>
        <Route path="*" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  )
}

export default App



// explanation of the following code =>
        <Route path="*" element={<Home />} />


here we say if user enters any url that is not valid the user must return to home pages

and if the user enters /  or  /home also return him to home page

else of the user enter /about sent him to about page where the about component is connected as following 
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />




then create an file called Navbar where we will implement the navigation with Link 

import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to="/home">Home</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </>
  )
}

export default Navbar



this way we are first importing Link then then trying to make the user navigate to every element he clicks

if he clicks  on li home he will be sent to /home and aslo that with about
