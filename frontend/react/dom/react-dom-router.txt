this is document how to use react-dom-router

first download the react-dom-router from npm

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from './pages/Home.jsx'
import About from './pages/About.jsx'

const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="*" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  )
}

export default Navbar


// explanation of the following code =>
        <Route path="*" element={<Home />} />


here we say if user enters any url that is not valid the user must return to home pages

and if the user enters /  or  /home also return him to home page

else of the user enter /about sent him to about page where the about component is connected as following 
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
