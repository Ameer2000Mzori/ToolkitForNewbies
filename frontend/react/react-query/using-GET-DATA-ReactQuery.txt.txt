as following if you want to use reactQuery you need to do the following 

first import the useQuery where you want to fetch data + import axios 
so as following : 

import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

then you need to use that Query as following : 


  const { data, isLoading, isFetching, isError } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["tasks"],
    queryFn: () => axios.get("http://localhost:5000/api/tasks"),
  });


this we we are first connecting to the api and we are getting the data and also we are getting more things
like as : 
data , isLoading, isFetching, and isError. those all you can use them as following : 

  if (isError) return <div>there is an error...</div>;
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading Data...</div>;

and more...
