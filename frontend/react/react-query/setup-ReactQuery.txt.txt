first you need to install reactQuery entering te following command in terminal

npm i @tanstack/react-query 

then you need to use reactQuery all over your application as following : 

got to main or app.js file of your reactjs project then import the two following things :

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

then you need to create new quertclient as following : 

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

and you need to use it as the following code : 

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <App />
  </QueryClientProvider>
);
