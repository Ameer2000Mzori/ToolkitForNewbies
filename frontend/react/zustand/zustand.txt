first download Zustand package entering following text in therminal : 

npm install zustand

then create a file called store.ts / store.js 

then import create from zustand as following : 

import { create } from "zustand";

then do the following thing : 

const useCounterStore = create(() => ({
count: 0, 
}));

this way we have used zustand like react redux toolkit and its a custom hook.
