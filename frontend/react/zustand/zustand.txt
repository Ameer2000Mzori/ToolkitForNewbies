first download Zustand package entering following text in therminal : 

npm install zustand

then create a file called store.ts / store.js 

then import create from zustand as following : 

import { create } from "zustand";

then do the following thing : 

const useCounterStore = create(() => ({
count: 0, 
}));

this way we have used zustand like react redux toolkit and its a custom hook. 


but now we will try to increment and decrement the count 

const useCounterStore = create(() => ({
count: 0,
increment: () => {},
decrement: () => {}, 
}));


now we will work more on the useCounterStore.

const useCounterStore = create(() => ({
count: 0,
increment: () => {
    set((state) => ({count: state.count + 1}))
},
decrement: () => {
    set((state) => ({count: state.count - 1}))
}, 
}));

now you can accces them to your home or app file as following 

first import useCounterStore 

then code the following thing to import any element is in ur useCounterStore 
import { useCounterStore } from "/your files" 

const count = useCounterStore((state) => state.count)
const increment = useCounterStore((state) => state.increment)
const decrement = useCounterStore((state) => state.decrement)
