this file is about useState hook 

1- first we need to import useState from reactjs as following : 

import react, { useState } from 'react'


then we will work with useState hook as following :

const [data, setData] = useState([])


here we have created a arry called data and we can add more items or data to it using setData.

imagine we have a array of objects: 

const usersList = [
    {
        name: 'list 1',
        age: 1,
    },
    {
        name: 'list 2',
        ag: 2,
    },
        {
        name: 'list 3',
        ag: 3,
    },
        {
        name: 'list 4',
        ag: 4,
    },
        {
        name: 'list 5',
        ag: 5,
    },
]

now if we want this data to be passed to the data array we will do it this way : 

setData(usersList)

and this way we have added out list to our data and now we can work with data and manipulating it our way.
