this file is the explanation of useEffect hook 

first we need to import useEffect as following:

import react, { useEffect } from "react";

this way we have imported useEffect.

now we need to work with the useEffect

and the setup is as following:

useEffect(()=>{

console.log('Hello World!')

},[])


as you can see we have set up the useEffect. 

code explanation :

everytime when the page is loaded, the useEffect will be called and will be called once
and in this case we will get a Hello World! message in our console window, but if you want to use the useEffect hook
multiple times, 

you need to  put something that updates inside of [] in your useEffect hook that we imagine we have something called count 

so  : 

useEffect(()=>{

console.log('Hello World!')

},[count])


this way if count becomes 1, we will get a Hello World! message in our console window
and if count becomes 2, we will get a Hello World! message
and if count becomes 3, we will get hello world again

this is how useEffect works
