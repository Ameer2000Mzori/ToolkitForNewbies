this file is explanation of the useReft hook in reactjs

first we need to import useRef as following : 


import react, { useRef } from "react";


and we use useRef as following : 


if we want to select h1 element in our data we need to do the following  :



// our data example 
<div>
<h1>this is test</h1>
</div>



// explanation:


first we need to put ref={name} 

on our element that we want to select in this case we want to select h1 element

so we will add as following : 

<h1 ref={ titleRef }>this is test</h1>


now after we added that title to our element we need to select it as followng :

const titleRef = useRef(null)

then we can manipulate h1 element as following if we want to change textContent : 

titleRef.current.textContent = 'this is test 1'

and for sure if you try this inside of an component it will work and the titleRef
or our title h1 element its textContent will be changed
