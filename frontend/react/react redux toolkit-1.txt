how to use redux toolkit and create store? do the following : 

1- fisrt we need to create file called store 

2- import configureStore as following : 


import {configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"


export const store  = configureStore({
reducer: {},

});



now we need to wrap our indexjs with redux toolkit as followking : 


1-fisrt import store 

2- then import Provider from react-redux as following : 

import {store} from './store'

import {Provider} from 'react-redux'


and wrap your app as following + pass it store prop: 


<Provider store={store}>
<App/> 
</Provider>


creation of first slice : 

- first create folder called features 

- within that folder create a folder called cart 

- then create file inside that called cartSlice.js


following step will teach you how to create slice : 



1- first import createSlice from @reduxjs/toolkit is following : 

2- import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"



3- do the following to create slice 



const initialState={
cartItem : [],
amout: 0, 
total : 0, 
isLoading: true,
}


export const cartSlice = createSlice ({

name: "cart", 
initialState

});




following stepes will connect slice that we created with store : 



1- first export cartSlice.reducer as following : 

export default cartSlice.reducer;



2 - go to store ans import cartReducer as following : 


import cartReducer from "the place of the file" 



3- put the cartReducer insdie the store as following : 




export const store  = configureStore({
reducer: { 

cart: cartReducer 

},

});



following steps will show you how to acces items from store using useSelector :
